## Description
A game to test a person's memory skill. This game is built in React which the application's UI is broken down into components, component state, and responding to user events.

## Functionality
Goal of the game is to click on an image once and only once! After clicking on any picture of a Looney Tune character, the pictures will randomly shuffle around and display  a catch phrase from that character!

Clicking a picture that hasn't being clicked already earns the user a point.

 If the user clicks on an image that has already being clicked, the user looses and the score will reset back to zero.

 User's topscore is kept tracked.

 Goal of the game is to beat the their own personal score!
